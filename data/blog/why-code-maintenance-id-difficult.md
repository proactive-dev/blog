Have you ever faced with a set of challenges — **Code Maintenance**?

Maintenance is a topic that has had very little light shed over it by experienced developers of the world.

If you’ve ever tried to update or fix a piece of code that someone else wrote, you would know how frustrating it can get.

There are a variety of reasons why it can be hard to maintain code, but some of the most common reasons are:

- The code is difficult to understand or is poorly written.
- The code is not well organized, and it is difficult to find the code you need.
- The code has been modified so many times that it is difficult to track down the original source code.
- The code is no longer supported by the original author or the company that owns the code.

### **Complexity of code maintenance is one of the main reasons for the high failure rate of software projects.**

In order to keep a software system running smoothly, the code must be constantly updated and tweaked to account for changes in the business environment, new requirements, and advances in technology.

This is a daunting task, and it’s often difficult to find the time and resources to do it properly.

As a result, many software systems become bogged down with legacy code that’s difficult to update and maintain.

Eventually, this would lead to performance issues and security vulnerabilities.

We battled these issues early-on during our development by focusing our efforts on writing code in modules (breaking it up into smaller, reusable components), and reusing them to reduce the amount of code that needs to be rewritten or updated each time there is a change in the business environment or system requirements.

Planning out our modules in advance is something that helped us address the problems associated with code maintenance and made the process easier and more efficient.

It saved us a lot of time and money, and it also helped ensure that our code is more reliable and secure.

In conclusion, Code Maintenance are heavily misunderstood topics.

Its complexity is not understood by inexperienced developers because they usually lack the depth of expertise needed.

**It is something you will learn once you dive into the deep end of software development & delivery.**
