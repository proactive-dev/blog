## What is the Single responsibility principle (SRP)?

SRP is a computer programming principle that states that every module, class, or function in a computer program should have responsibility for a single part of that program's functionality, and it should encapsulate just that part.

But we can put this principle to team communication.

Usually, we use Slack or Discord or some other channel based applications for team communication. This make the team put the SRP to the communication.

Let's see.


## Why do we use the Single Responsibility Principle for communication?

### Predictability

When a channel gets highlighted we know what sort of notification to expect. We can decide to handle it now or later if we are busy right now.

### Control

Large general channels are difficult to follow through if you've missed the beginning of the conversation. It can make you need to check your Slack all day long to be sure you are not missing anything. Separating conversations into smaller channels helps you gain control by deciding when you want to answer during the day. So you can have productive time and time where you focus on communicating.

### Asynchronous conversations

We believe asynchronous communication is fundamental to productive work. By separating concerns (topics) into small chunks we make it easier to follow through a specific topic asynchronously since you can read and react to what is relevant to you.


## How do we use those principles in communication channels?

By having specific channels for each topic, we can make it possible to asynchronously work together and get work done.
